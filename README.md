# SODASCRIPT - Refresh your Windows experience

As Mentos fizzes the Soda!

## DESCRIPTION

An advanced & integrated PowerShell script, -more than any other PowerShell script-,Soda Script optimizes Windows 10 performance to the maximum, while maintaining a stable, and bug-free system..

## COMPATIBILITY

Soda focuses and works efficiently on the latest versions of Windows 10 supported by Microsoft. (21H2:20H2)

Running Soda on previous versions of Windows that are not supported by Microsoft will be at your own risk. Soda has not been tested on them, and errors may occur with them.

 **Windows 11:**

Soda is not ready for Windows 11 yet. Running it on Windows 11 will be at your own risk.

However, we are planning to release a new Soda ready for Windows 11 in the near future...

## DOWNLOAD

Download the latest Soda release:

[Download](https://github.com/SychoAN/SodaScript/releases/download/2.7/SodaScript.ps1)

## WARNING

While the Soda downloads files from the Internet (ex: Power Plan profiles), Microsoft Defender suspects Soda, stops the script, and deletes the script with the files. You must disable Microsoft Defender before you start!

The most popular & intelligent antiviruses might not suspect Soda, but we recommend you to turn it off to avoid any potential error during the process.

If you suspect that a script may harm your device, remember that it is open source, and everything it does is clear.

## USAGE
There are many ways to run a PowerShell script, and we will refer to the easiest & fastest:

1. Download Soda .zip archive from the [DOWNLOAD](https://github.com/SychoAN/SodaScriptTEST/blob/main/README.md#download) section above, and extract it in some path.

2. Navigate to the path where you extracted the .zip archive, locate ```SodaScript.ps1``` file, Right-click on it, and click on ```Run with PowerShell```.

3. Accept the User Account Control (UAC) prompt.

4. Accept the Execution Policy Change.

## KNOWN ISSUES
