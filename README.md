# SODASCRIPT - Refresh your Windows experience

As Mentos fizzes the Soda!

## DESCRIPTION

An advanced & integrated PowerShell script, -more than any other PowerShell script-, optimizes Windows 10 performance to the maximum, while maintaining a stable, and bug-free system.

## DOWNLOAD

Download the latest Soda release:

[Download [.zip archive]](LINK_HERE)

## WARNING

While the Soda downloads files from the Internet (ex: Power Plan profiles), Microsoft Defender suspects Soda, stops the script, and deletes the script with the files. You must disable Microsoft Defender before you start!

The most popular & intelligent antiviruses might not suspect Soda, but we recommend you to turn it off to avoid any potential error during the process.

If you suspect that a script may harm your device, remember that it is open source, and everything it does is clear.

## USAGE

1. Download Soda .zip archive from the [DOWNLOAD](https://github.com/SychoAN/SodaScriptTEST/blob/main/README.md#download) section above, and extract it in some path.

2. Navigate to the path where you extracted the .zip archive, locate ```SodaScript.ps1``` file, Right-click on it, and click on ```Run with PowerShell```.

3. Accept the User Account Control (UAC) prompt.

4. Accept the Execution Policy Change.
